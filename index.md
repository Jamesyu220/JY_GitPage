### High Level Description and Motivation
People have a unique ability to have conversations with each other without ever saying a word. Hand gestures are regularly used as quick nonverbal forms of communication to convey things like “good job” with a thumbs up, or “hello” with a wave. Moreover, there are hand gestures in use for critical systems. Think of an airplane or a cargo ship being directed by a person on the ground. With just a few hand motions, the person directing can communicate with the driver how to steer this giant vehicle exactly where it needs to be. Sometimes words are not the right tool for communicating something, especially when it comes to motion.
